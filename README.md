# pr-shepherd

Autonomous PR CI monitor and review-comment resolver for Claude Code.
The goal is to have an agent take a plan to a human-reviewable PR autonomously.

Example Workflow:

1. `/model opusplan`
2. Create a plan
3. Accept the plan
4. Switch to Auto Mode
5. Prompt: `make a PR, then run /pr-shepherd:monitor`
6. Agent makes a draft PR
7. PR has passing CI -> draft is marked Ready for Review
8. Review bots begin providing reviews
9. Agent automatically classifies and fixes review comments based on the Plan
10. Human reviews PR with passing CI, no open threads, and all comments minimized

## How it works

`pr-shepherd` optimizes token management, rate limits, and agentic orchestration by moving **ALL** deterministic logic and prompts to code via a CLI tool, enshrining what would be a large skill or command prompt (of which the agent would inevitably make mistakes) into the code and returning a clear, actionable prompt.

At a high-level, to start the monitor, the skill/command invokes a CLI that returns a prompt to be ingested by the agent:

```bash
/pr-shepherd:monitor

> npx pr-shepherd monitor 123

Run /loop "npx pr-shepherd iterate 123" every 4 minutes
```

Each iteration calls `npx pr-shepherd iterate <PR>`, which provides actionable feedback directly to the agent:

```bash
> npx pr-shepherd iterate 123

# PR #123 [FIX_CODE]

**status** `UNRESOLVED_COMMENTS` · **merge** `BLOCKED` · **state** `OPEN` · **repo** `owner/repo`
**summary** 3 passing, 0 skipped, 0 filtered, 0 inProgress · **copilotReviewInProgress** false · **isDraft** false

## Review threads

### `PRRT_kwDOSGizTs58XB1L` — `src/commands/iterate.mts:42` (@alice)

<!--
  Return all review threads with IDs for minimization
  Code suggestions are converted into diffs and can be applied without reading & writing the file
-->

> The variable name is misleading.
>
> Consider renaming `x` to `remainingSeconds` so readers don't have to
> trace back to the declaration to understand its meaning.

## Failing checks

<!-- Only failing checks are returned -->

- `24697658766` — `CI › lint / typecheck / test (22.x)`
  > npx oxfmt <!-- return the exact step it failed, which avoids loading `gh view run <id>` into context for many scenarios -->

## Post-fix push

- base: `main`
- resolve: `npx pr-shepherd resolve 42 --resolve-thread-ids PRRT_kwDOSGizTs58XB1L --minimize-comment-ids IC_kwDOSGizTs7_ajT8,IC_kwDOSGizTs7_ajT9 --dismiss-review-ids PRR_kwDOSGizTs58XB1R --message "$DISMISS_MESSAGE" --require-sha "$HEAD_SHA"`

## Instructions

1. Fix the code
2. [Shown only if the branch is out of date] Rebase <DEFAULT BRANCH> if out of date
3. [If rebased] git push --force-with-lease [If not rebased] git push
4. Resolve/minimize comments
5. Stop
```

On every iteration, a command is returned to instruct the agent exactly what to do. No guessing, no thinking, as few agentic turns as possible:

```bash
`npx pr-shepherd resolve 42 --resolve-thread-ids PRRT_kwDOSGizTs58XB1L --minimize-comment-ids IC_kwDOSGizTs7_ajT8,IC_kwDOSGizTs7_ajT9 --dismiss-review-ids PRR_kwDOSGizTs58XB1R --message "$DISMISS_MESSAGE" --require-sha "$HEAD_SHA"`
```

## Why pr-shepherd

Concrete improvements to an agentic PR-review workflow:

- **Faster monitor loops** — one batched GraphQL query per tick (see [docs/graphql.md](docs/graphql.md)) instead of N REST round-trips
- **Lower context usage per iteration** — classification lives in the CLI; the agent receives one decision per tick and never sees raw GraphQL payloads or resolved threads
- **Prompt-cache friendly** — the 4-minute default tick is tuned to Claude's 5-minute prompt-cache TTL (tunable via `watch.interval`)
- **Reduced GitHub rate-limit exposure** — one batched GraphQL read per tick; loop-state files (fix-attempts, stall detection, ready-delay timer) are kept in `$TMPDIR/pr-shepherd-state/`
- **No MCP surface** — skills call the CLI via `npx`; no long-lived MCP server, no extra auth boundary, smaller reasoning surface
- **Skills over subagents** — skill prompts inject into the main conversation rather than spawning a subagent that reloads CLAUDE.md every turn
- **Safe to interrupt** — all state lives in the PR on GitHub; the cron loop self-terminates when the PR is merged, closed, or settles after ready-delay

## Design principles

- **Reduced agent context** — logic lives in the CLI, not the prompt
- **Reduced GitHub rate-limit exhaustion** — primary PR state is fetched via a batched GraphQL query
- **Fewer tool calls** — comment resolutions are batched; resolved threads never reach the agent
- **Skills over subagents** — subagents reload all CLAUDE.md context on every turn; skills inject into the main conversation instead, keeping cost low
- **JSON/text parity** — `--format=json` and `--format=text` carry equivalent information; every field in one has a representation in the other

## Usage

### Monitor a PR

Creates a cron loop that fires every 4 minutes, checks CI and review
comments, fixes issues, and marks the PR ready for review when clean. The
loop cancels automatically when the PR is merged or closed.

```
/pr-shepherd:monitor                     # infer PR from current branch
/pr-shepherd:monitor 42
/pr-shepherd:monitor 42 every 8m
/pr-shepherd:monitor 42 --ready-delay 15m
```

### Check a PR

One-shot status snapshot — merge state, CI results, and unresolved comments.
Accepts multiple PR numbers.

```
/pr-shepherd:check        # infer from branch
/pr-shepherd:check 42
/pr-shepherd:check 41 42 43
```

### Resolve review comments

Fetches all actionable threads and comments, triages them, applies fixes,
pushes, then resolves/minimizes/dismisses via `--require-sha` (waits until
GitHub has seen the push before resolving).

```
/pr-shepherd:resolve       # infer from branch
/pr-shepherd:resolve 42
```

See [docs/skills.md](docs/skills.md) for full argument reference.

## Workflow

On each tick (4-minute default, tunable via `watch.interval`): fetch PR state in one GraphQL batch → classify CI, comments, and merge status → take one action (fix code, rebase, rerun CI, mark ready, or wait). See [docs/iterate-flow.md](docs/iterate-flow.md) for the decision table and [docs/flow.md](docs/flow.md) for the end-to-end flow diagram.

## Install

> **Note:** Skill and plugin install methods add the skill definitions only — they do not install the `pr-shepherd` CLI. The skills invoke `npx pr-shepherd`, so you also need the CLI available. If you're using `pr-shepherd` as development tooling for your repo, install it as a dev dependency so `npx` resolves it without prompting:
>
> ```bash
> npm install --save-dev pr-shepherd
> ```
>
> A plain `npm install pr-shepherd` adds it to regular dependencies instead; use that only if you specifically want it under `dependencies`. Or install globally: `npm install -g pr-shepherd`.

### As individual skills via `npx skills`

```bash
npx skills add jonathanong/pr-shepherd
```

Installs the three skills (`check`, `monitor`, `resolve`) into your agent's skill directory (`.claude/skills/` for project scope, `~/.claude/skills/` with `-g` for global scope). Powered by [skills.sh](https://skills.sh).

### As a Claude Code plugin (recommended)

```bash
claude /plugin marketplace add jonathanong/pr-shepherd
claude /plugin install pr-shepherd
```

This repo ships two `marketplace.json` files that serve different install flows: the root `marketplace.json` resolves the plugin from the npm registry (used by the `claude /plugin marketplace add` command above); `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` is the owner-level registry manifest that resolves the plugin from the local plugin directory (used when Claude Code installs from a local or git-based source). Both files are needed to support these two install paths.

### Without the plugin

See [docs/custom-commands.md](docs/custom-commands.md) for a project-local slash command that wraps the CLI without the plugin.

### As a global CLI

```bash
npm install -g pr-shepherd
```

## Configuration

Create a `.pr-shepherdrc.yml` in your project root (or any parent directory) to override defaults. The loader walks up from `cwd` to `$HOME` (if `$HOME` is on that path) or the filesystem root; the first match wins.

```yaml
iterate:
  cooldownSeconds: 60 # wait longer after a push before reading CI
checks:
  ciTriggerEvents:
    - pull_request
    - pull_request_target
    - merge_group # add for merge-queue repos
actions:
  autoRebase: false # disable for repos that enforce merge commits
```

Environment variables: `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN` (auth; falls back to `gh auth token`), `PR_SHEPHERD_STATE_DIR` (override loop-state base dir).

See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) for full semantics and deprecated-key migration.

## Requirements

- Node.js ≥ 22.0.0
- A GitHub token: set `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN`, **or** install and authenticate the `gh` CLI (`gh auth login`) — pr-shepherd uses `gh auth token` as a fallback. The `repo` scope is required for private repositories.
- `git`

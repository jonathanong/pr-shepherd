  You have no shell and no network access. Do not run shell commands, fetch
  anything over the network, or read repository files other than a reference
  file linked from a skill you loaded. Do not ask for the repository to be provided.

  You MAY use any skill available to you. If a skill is relevant to this request,
  load it before you plan. If that skill points at a reference file, read it
  before you plan.

  State the plan you would execute, as concrete numbered steps that someone could
  follow without you. Where a step runs a command, give the exact command. Where
  you decide NOT to take an action that the output appears to offer, say so
  explicitly and say why.

## Post-fix actions

- base: `main`
- apply review: `pr-shepherd apply review https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/42 --reply-thread-ids PRRT_thrash_84 --message "$DISMISS_MESSAGE" --dismiss-review-ids PRR_bot_overdue_84 --require-sha "$HEAD_SHA"`

## Instructions

1. Review each item under `## Review threads`, `## Changes-requested reviews` and decide whether it needs a code change.
2. Apply every warranted review fix in each file referenced above.
3. Read every body under `## Changes-requested reviews` and apply any warranted change.
4. If you changed code, commit any remaining changes and push to the PR head branch. If you did not, do not commit.
5. For any substantial decision or rejection, append `- <decision>` to Shepherd Journal with `pr-shepherd apply journal https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/42 '- <decision>'`. Playbook: "Shepherd Journal".
6. If you did not change code, replace `$HEAD_SHA` with `$(git rev-parse HEAD)` (it must equal the remote PR head). If you did, use the pushed SHA.
7. Replace `$DISMISS_MESSAGE` with one sentence describing what changed.
8. Run the `apply review:` command above. Playbook: "Review-mutation mechanics".
9. `[FIX_CODE]` is non-terminal. Iterate immediately with the same options.

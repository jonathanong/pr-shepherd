  You have no shell and no network access. Do not run shell commands, fetch
  anything over the network, or read repository files other than a reference
  file linked from a skill you loaded. Do not ask for the repository to be provided.

  You MAY use any skill available to you. If a skill is relevant to this request,
  load it before you plan. If that skill points at a reference file, read it
  before you plan.

  State the plan you would execute, as concrete numbered steps that someone could
  follow without you. Where a step runs a command, give the exact command. Where
  you decide NOT to take an action that the output appears to offer, say so
  explicitly and say why.

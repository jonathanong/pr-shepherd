## Instructions

1. Review each item under `## Review threads`, `## Actionable comments`, `## Failing checks`, `## Changes-requested reviews` and decide whether it needs a code change.
2. Apply every warranted review fix in each file referenced above.
3. Triage every failure under `## Failing checks`. See "CI failure triage" in the pr-shepherd skill for read-only inspection rules.
4. A `[rerun authorized]` check includes a `rerun:` command. See "CI failure triage" in the pr-shepherd skill for which conclusions warrant a rerun versus a code fix.
5. Read every body under `## Changes-requested reviews` and apply any warranted change.
6. If you changed code, commit any remaining changes and push to the PR head branch, then run the remaining review mutations using the pushed commit SHA and iterate immediately with the same options. If you did not change code, do not commit and continue with the remaining steps.
7. For any substantial decision or rejection, append `- <decision>` to Shepherd Journal with `pr-shepherd apply journal https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/42 '- <decision>'`. See "Shepherd Journal" in the pr-shepherd skill for citation conventions.
8. If you did not change code, replace `$HEAD_SHA` with `$(git rev-parse HEAD)`, which must equal the current remote PR head. If you changed code, commit and push to the PR head branch first, then replace `$HEAD_SHA` with the pushed commit SHA.
9. Replace `$DISMISS_MESSAGE` with one sentence describing what changed.
10. Run the `apply review:` command shown above. See "Review-mutation mechanics" in the pr-shepherd skill for dismiss-ID retention.
11. `[FIX_CODE]` is non-terminal: if you changed code, commit and push to the PR head branch, then run the review mutations using the pushed commit SHA and iterate immediately with the same options; if you did not change code, complete the authorized review mutations and iterate immediately with the same options.

## In-progress runs

- `111`

## Post-fix push

- base: `main`

## Instructions

1. Decide for each item under `## Actionable comments` whether a code change is warranted. **If any code changes are needed:** cancel in-progress runs first, apply edits, commit, rebase, push. **If no code changes are needed:** no push is needed.
2. If you decide to push new commits: cancel each in-progress run listed under `## In-progress runs` before applying code fixes (e.g. `gh run cancel <id>`). Runs may complete between the tick and your action; treat cancellation errors on already-finished runs as non-fatal. Skip this step if you are only resolving threads without pushing — the existing runs remain relevant.
3. Apply code fixes: read and edit each file referenced under `## Review threads` and `## Actionable comments` above.
4. If you applied code edits: commit them with a descriptive message, then rebase onto `origin/main` per your repository's conventions before pushing.
5. For any large decisions or rejections you made this iteration, run `pr-shepherd journal 42 '- <decision>'` to append an entry to the `## Shepherd Journal` section. For threads and comments, use the markdown link shown in its heading above; for reviews, reference the review ID. The command is idempotent — re-running with the same text is a no-op.
6. Stop this iteration — if you pushed new commits, CI needs time before the next tick; otherwise stop before the next tick. Recheck: rerun `pr-shepherd 42` to recheck once after a fresh 30s–4m delay.

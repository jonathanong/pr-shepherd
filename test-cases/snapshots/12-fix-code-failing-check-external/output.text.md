## Post-fix actions

- base: `main`

## Instructions

1. Review each item under `## Failing checks` and decide whether it needs a code change.
2. Triage every failure under `## Failing checks`. See "CI failure triage" in the pr-shepherd skill for read-only inspection rules.
3. If you changed code, commit any remaining changes and push to the PR head branch, then run the remaining review mutations using the pushed commit SHA and iterate again with the same options. If you did not change code, do not commit and continue with the remaining steps.
4. For any substantial decision or rejection, append `- <decision>` to Shepherd Journal with `pr-shepherd apply journal https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/42 '- <decision>'`. See "Shepherd Journal" in the pr-shepherd skill for citation conventions.
5. `[FIX_CODE]` is non-terminal. After completing these steps, iterate again with the same options to continue.

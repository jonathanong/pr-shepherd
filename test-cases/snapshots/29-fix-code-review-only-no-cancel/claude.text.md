## Instructions

1. Decide for each item under `## Review threads`, `## Changes-requested reviews` whether a code change is warranted. **If any code changes are needed:** cancel in-progress runs first, apply edits, commit, push, then run the `resolve:` command. **If no code changes are needed:** skip cancellation/commit/push and run only the `resolve:` command.
2. If you decide to push new commits: cancel each in-progress run listed under `## In-progress runs` before applying code fixes (e.g. `gh run cancel <id>`). Skip this step if you are only resolving threads without pushing — the existing runs remain relevant.
3. Apply code fixes: read and edit each file referenced under `## Review threads` and `## Actionable comments` above.
4. For each bullet under `## Changes-requested reviews` above: read the review body and apply the requested changes.
5. If you applied code edits: commit them with a descriptive message, then rebase onto `origin/main` per your repository's conventions before pushing.
6. Run the `resolve:` command shown above, substituting `$HEAD_SHA` with the pushed commit SHA (or `$(git rev-parse HEAD)` if you did not push) and `$DISMISS_MESSAGE` with a one-sentence description of what you changed.
7. For any large decisions or rejections you made this iteration, add or update a `## Shepherd Journal` section in the PR description (`gh pr edit 42 --body …`) summarizing each decision. For threads and comments, use the markdown link shown in its heading above; for reviews, reference the review ID. If this section already exists, append your entries under it instead of creating a duplicate heading.
8. Stop this iteration — if you pushed new commits, CI needs time before the next tick; otherwise stop before the next tick. Single-shot continuation: schedule one session-only follow-up task to run `npx pr-shepherd 42` to recheck once after a fresh delay between 30 seconds and 4 minutes, then end this turn. Do not sleep or rerun inline.

## Post-fix actions

- base: `main`
- apply review: `pr-shepherd apply review https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/42 --transport rest --reply-thread-ids PRRT_main --message "$DISMISS_MESSAGE" --require-sha "$HEAD_SHA"`

## Instructions

1. Review each item under `## Review threads`, `## Actionable comments` and decide whether it needs a code change.
2. Read each body under `## Review summaries (first look)` and journal any warranted note before review mutations. Playbook: "Shepherd Journal".
3. Apply every warranted review fix in each file referenced above.
4. If you changed code, commit any remaining changes and push to the PR head branch. If you did not, do not commit.
5. For any substantial decision or rejection, append `- <decision>` to Shepherd Journal with `pr-shepherd apply journal https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/42 --transport rest '- <decision>'`. Playbook: "Shepherd Journal".
6. If you did not change code, replace `$HEAD_SHA` with `$(git rev-parse HEAD)` (it must equal the remote PR head). If you did, use the pushed SHA.
7. Replace `$DISMISS_MESSAGE` with one sentence describing what changed.
8. Run the `apply review:` command above. Playbook: "Review-mutation mechanics".
9. `[FIX_CODE]` is non-terminal. Iterate immediately with the same options.

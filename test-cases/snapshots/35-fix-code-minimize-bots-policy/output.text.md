## Post-fix push

- resolve: `pr-shepherd resolve 42 --reply-thread-ids PRRT_main --message "$DISMISS_MESSAGE" --minimize-comment-ids PRR_bot1 --require-sha "$HEAD_SHA"`

## Instructions

1. Decide for each item under `## Review threads`, `## Actionable comments` whether a code change is warranted. **If any code changes are needed:** cancel in-progress runs first, apply edits, commit, rebase, push, then run the `resolve:` command. **If no code changes are needed:** skip cancellation/commit/push and run the `resolve:` command.
2. Apply code fixes: read and edit each file referenced under `## Review threads` and `## Actionable comments` above.
3. If you applied code edits: commit them with a descriptive message, then rebase onto `origin/main` per your repository's conventions before pushing.
4. Run the `resolve:` command shown above, substituting `$HEAD_SHA` with the pushed commit SHA (or `$(git rev-parse HEAD)` if you did not push) and `$DISMISS_MESSAGE` with a one-sentence reply/description of what you changed.
5. Review the bodies shown under `## Review summaries (first look)` — you are seeing these for the first time. Any IDs eligible for minimization are already included in the resolve command's `--minimize-comment-ids`; if any warrants a Shepherd Journal note, append it before running resolve.
6. For any large decisions or rejections you made this iteration, add or update a `## Shepherd Journal` section in the PR description (`gh pr edit 42 --body …`) summarizing each decision. For threads and comments, use the markdown link shown in its heading above; for reviews, reference the review ID. If this section already exists, append your entries under it instead of creating a duplicate heading.
7. Stop this iteration — if you pushed new commits, CI needs time before the next tick; otherwise stop before the next tick. Recheck: rerun `pr-shepherd 42` to recheck once after a fresh 30s–4m delay.

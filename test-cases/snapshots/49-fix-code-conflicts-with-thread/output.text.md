## Post-fix actions

- base: `main`
- apply review: `pr-shepherd apply review https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/42 --reply-thread-ids PRRT_conflict_thread --message "$DISMISS_MESSAGE" --require-sha "$HEAD_SHA"`

## Instructions

1. Review each item under `## Review threads` and decide whether it needs a code change.
2. The branch has merge conflicts (see `**branch**` above). Resolve them before committing.
3. Apply every warranted review fix in each file referenced above.
4. Commit any remaining conflict-resolution changes and push to the PR head branch before review mutations.
5. For any substantial decision or rejection, append `- <decision>` to Shepherd Journal with `pr-shepherd apply journal https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/42 '- <decision>'`. See "Shepherd Journal" in the pr-shepherd skill for citation conventions.
6. Run the generated thread IDs unchanged. A latest comment beginning `<!-- pr-shepherd -->` is an established Shepherd reply; a marked viewer-authored human thread is emitted resolve-only, not for another reply.
7. If you did not change code, replace `$HEAD_SHA` with `$(git rev-parse HEAD)`, which must equal the current remote PR head. If you changed code, commit and push to the PR head branch first, then replace `$HEAD_SHA` with the pushed commit SHA.
8. Replace `$DISMISS_MESSAGE` with one sentence describing what changed.
9. Run the `apply review:` command shown above. See "Review-mutation mechanics" in the pr-shepherd skill for dismiss-ID retention.
10. `[FIX_CODE]` is non-terminal: resolve the conflicts, commit, push to the PR head branch, then iterate immediately with the same options.

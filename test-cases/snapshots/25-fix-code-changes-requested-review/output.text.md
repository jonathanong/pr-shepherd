## Instructions

1. Review each item under `## Review threads`, `## Changes-requested reviews` and decide whether it needs a code change.
2. Apply every warranted review fix in each file referenced above.
3. Read every body under `## Changes-requested reviews` and apply any warranted change.
4. If you changed code, commit any remaining changes and push before review mutations. Otherwise, do not commit or push.
5. For any substantial decision or rejection, append `- <decision>` to `## Shepherd Journal` with `pr-shepherd apply journal 42 '- <decision>'`.
6. Link threads and comments from their headings. Cite reviews by ID.
7. Before `apply review:`, remove any `--reply-thread-ids` entry whose latest visible comment is your own Shepherd reply. Do not reply to yourself.
8. Replace `$HEAD_SHA` with the pushed commit SHA, or `$(git rev-parse HEAD)` if you did not push.
9. Replace `$DISMISS_MESSAGE` with one sentence describing what changed.
10. Run the `apply review:` command shown above.
11. `[FIX_CODE]` is non-terminal. After completing these steps, continue with the next poll using the same interface and mode: rerun the current `pr-shepherd` CLI invocation with its flags, or call MCP `iterate` again.

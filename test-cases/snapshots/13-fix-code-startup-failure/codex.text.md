## Failing checks

- `999` — `CI (startup failure)` [conclusion: STARTUP_FAILURE]
  > Process exited early

## Cancelled runs

- `999`

## Post-fix push

- base: `main`

## Instructions

1. Decide for each item under `## Failing checks` whether a code change is warranted. **If any code changes are needed:** cancel in-progress runs first, apply edits, commit, rebase if the header shows `**branch**` behind/conflicts, push, then run the `resolve:` command. **If no code changes are needed:** skip cancellation/commit/push and run only the `resolve:` command.
2. For each failing check under `## Failing checks`: for `[conclusion: STARTUP_FAILURE]` entries: inspect with `gh run view <runId>` and rerun with `gh run rerun <runId>` if the workflow should be retried.
3. If you applied code edits: commit them with a descriptive message, then rebase onto `origin/main` per your repository's conventions before pushing.
4. Do not re-run `gh run cancel` on the IDs listed under `## Cancelled runs` — the CLI cancelled those runs before your push, and your push has already triggered new runs with different IDs.
5. Stop this iteration — if you pushed new commits, CI needs time before the next tick; otherwise stop before the next tick. Pick a fresh sleep/timeout between 30 seconds and 4 minutes, wait that long, then rerun `npx pr-shepherd 42` to recheck.

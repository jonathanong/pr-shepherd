- base: `main`

## Instructions

1. Review each item under `## Changes-requested reviews` and decide whether it needs a code change.
2. Read every body under `## Changes-requested reviews` and apply any warranted change.
3. If you changed code, commit any remaining changes and push to the PR head branch. If you did not, do not commit.
4. For any substantial decision or rejection, append `- <decision>` to Shepherd Journal with `pr-shepherd apply journal https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/42 '- <decision>'`. Playbook: "Shepherd Journal".
5. If you did not change code, replace `$HEAD_SHA` with `$(git rev-parse HEAD)` (it must equal the remote PR head). If you did, use the pushed SHA.
6. Replace `$DISMISS_MESSAGE` with one sentence describing what changed.
7. Run the `apply review:` command above. Playbook: "Review-mutation mechanics".
8. `[FIX_CODE]` is non-terminal. Iterate immediately with the same options.

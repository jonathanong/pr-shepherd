## Instructions

1. Review each item under `## Review threads`, `## Failing checks` and decide whether it needs a code change.
2. Do not cancel the IDs under `## Cancelled runs` again. The CLI already cancelled them.
3. Apply every warranted review fix in each file referenced above.
4. Triage every failure under `## Failing checks`. See "CI failure triage" in the pr-shepherd skill for `gh run view` / `gh run rerun` rules.
5. If you changed code, commit any remaining changes and push before review mutations. Otherwise, do not commit or push.
6. For any substantial decision or rejection, append `- <decision>` to Shepherd Journal with `pr-shepherd apply journal 42 '- <decision>'`. See "Shepherd Journal" in the pr-shepherd skill for citation conventions.
7. Replace `$HEAD_SHA` with the pushed commit SHA, or `$(git rev-parse HEAD)` if you did not push.
8. Replace `$DISMISS_MESSAGE` with one sentence describing what changed.
9. Run the `apply review:` command shown above. See "Review-mutation mechanics" in the pr-shepherd skill for the self-reply exclusion rule and dismiss-ID retention.
10. `[FIX_CODE]` is non-terminal. After completing these steps, iterate again to continue.

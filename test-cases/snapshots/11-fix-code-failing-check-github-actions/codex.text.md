## Failing checks

- `1234567890` — `CI › tests (ubuntu)` [conclusion: FAILURE]
  > Run tests

## Cancelled runs

- `1234567890`

## Post-fix push

- base: `main`

## Instructions

1. Decide for each item under `## Failing checks` whether a code change is warranted. **If any code changes are needed:** cancel in-progress runs first, apply edits, commit, rebase, push. **If no code changes are needed:** no push is needed.
2. For each failing check under `## Failing checks`: fetch the log with `gh run view <runId> --log-failed` and decide: rerun with `gh run rerun <runId> --failed` for transient infrastructure failures (network timeout, OOM kill, runner crash), or apply a code fix for real test/build failures.
3. If you applied code edits: commit them with a descriptive message, then rebase onto `origin/main` per your repository's conventions before pushing.
4. Do not re-run `gh run cancel` on the IDs listed under `## Cancelled runs` — those runs were already cancelled by the CLI before this turn.
5. Stop this iteration — if you pushed new commits, CI needs time before the next tick; otherwise stop before the next tick. Recheck: rerun `npx pr-shepherd 42` to recheck once after a fresh 30s–4m delay.

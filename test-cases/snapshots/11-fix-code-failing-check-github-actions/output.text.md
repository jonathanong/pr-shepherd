## Post-fix actions

- base: `main`

## Instructions

1. Review each item under `## Failing checks` and decide whether it needs a code change.
2. Triage every failure under `## Failing checks`. See "CI failure triage" in the pr-shepherd skill for read-only inspection rules.
3. A `[rerun authorized]` check includes a `rerun:` command. See "CI failure triage" in the pr-shepherd skill for which conclusions warrant a rerun versus a code fix.
4. If you changed code, commit and push the changes, then iterate again; do not run the remaining review mutations until the remote PR head reflects your push. If you did not change code, do not commit and continue with the remaining steps.
5. For any substantial decision or rejection, append `- <decision>` to Shepherd Journal with `pr-shepherd apply journal https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/42 '- <decision>'`. See "Shepherd Journal" in the pr-shepherd skill for citation conventions.
6. `[FIX_CODE]` is non-terminal. Run any warranted reruns for `[rerun authorized]` checks (or apply code fixes for real failures), then iterate again with the same options to continue.

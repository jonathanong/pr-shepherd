# shepherd comments and threads

[← README.md](README.md)

## Review threads vs PR comments

| Type          | Description                                            | GraphQL field               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Review thread | Inline code comment attached to a specific file + line | `pullRequest.reviewThreads` |
| PR comment    | Top-level comment on the PR (not attached to a file)   | `pullRequest.comments`      |

Shepherd reports both types in the `report.threads` and `report.comments` fields respectively.

## `isOutdated` flag

GitHub sets `isOutdated: true` on a review thread when the commit the comment was originally attached to has been superseded by a newer push. Outdated threads are no longer blocking — the code they commented on no longer exists in the current state of the PR.

Shepherd auto-resolves outdated threads during the sweep step (when `autoResolve: true`).

## Auto-resolve path

1. `getOutdatedThreads(unresolvedThreads)` — filters for `isOutdated: true` threads from `batch.mts` data
2. `autoResolveOutdated(threadIds)` — fires GraphQL `resolveReviewThread` mutations in parallel
3. Resolved thread IDs and any errors are returned in `report.threads.autoResolved` and `report.threads.autoResolveErrors`

Auto-resolve happens in `check.mts` when `opts.autoResolve === true` (set by `iterate`).

## Actionable triage is LLM-side

Shepherd does **not** classify threads as "actionable" vs "informational" — that's the LLM's job. Shepherd surfaces:

- All active (non-outdated, unresolved) threads in `report.threads.actionable`
- All visible (non-minimized) PR comments in `report.comments.actionable`

The cron prompt reads these and decides what to fix.

## `--require-sha` polling

When `shepherd resolve --require-sha <SHA>` is used, shepherd polls `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}` for `headRefOid` until it matches `expectedSha`, then issues the resolve/minimize/dismiss mutations.

**Why:** Without this guard, shepherd might auto-merge before the reviewer sees the fix. The polling ensures GitHub has received the push and updated the PR head before any mutations fire.

**Polling:** Retries up to `(maxAttempts − 1)` times with `pollIntervalMs` delay. Transient 5xx errors are retried; 4xx errors are fatal.

## Mutation types

All mutations live in `comments/resolve.mts`:

| Mutation         | GraphQL file                      | What it does                                        |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Resolve thread   | `github/gql/resolve-thread.gql`   | Marks a review thread resolved                      |
| Minimize comment | `github/gql/minimize-comment.gql` | Hides a PR comment (marks it as spam/resolved)      |
| Dismiss review   | `github/gql/dismiss-review.gql`   | Dismisses a CHANGES_REQUESTED review with a message |
